# TradieConnect README

## About the Project
This repository is for the development of a system for the University of Wollongong, the subject is CSIT314 (Systems Development Methodologies). The system will allow for three types of users. 
1. System Admin: This user can see all customers, all service providers and all requests. They can also view all of these plus additional statistics in a report PDF
2. Customer: A customer can make a new request, review and accept a service provider and review a completed job. They can also generate report data on their account information (payment info), as well as the requests they've made. They can also update personal information 
3. Service Provider: The Service Providers can apply for available jobs (same skill as job and within 50 kilometres of the customer). If they're accepted, the job moves into their current requests. Once completed, the service provider can mark the job as completed. This will allow the customer to review the job and they will receive this review whenever it is completed. The service provider can also generate report PDF data with statistics and information on available, current and past jobs. They too can edit their user information.
